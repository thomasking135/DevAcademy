#Reflections 

*Command Line*

**In a couple of sentences, how would you describe the command line in plain English? Can you think of an analogy for it?**

It is like a navigation tool for moving around my PC. I see it like using Google Maps.

**Did you stick to the timebox guidelines? If not, what change would you make next time?**

No, because I explored topics a little further in depth. I think I'll manage my time better.
**Name 5 commands you used and what they do.**
The cd (Chnage directory) to display the name of items in the directory.
The mkdir (Make directory) to create a new directory on my system.
The help (help) command to display a set of commands.
The rmdir (remove directory) to remove a directory from my system.
The .. (go back) command to go bact a directory (and also the up arrow key to see options used before)

**Did you learn anything unexpected?**

Yes, the CLI can be very fast when time is taken to learn it.


*Version Control with Git* 

**Whats the difference between Git and GitHub?**
Git is a tool for version control while Guthub is the cloud based service for projects that use Git.

**Can you think of an analogy to describe them?**
I would say a pot luck dinner. Many people use Git and this is uploaded to the cloud. From there, the best bits can be taken to form a project.

**Do you think you would still remember the difference a week from now if you didn't revisit the material?** 
I think so. I have a reasonable familiarity with Git and GitHub.

**Did you stick to the timebox suggestions? If not, why not?**
No, but the time was close. I did have to avoid looking beyond what the activities asked of me. 

*Install and Explore Git*

**What is a GitHub work flow?**
It is an automated action added to the repository to manage a project on GitHub.

**What did you notice about your own learning? What did you do when you were confused or blocked?**
I went to the Slack page and often found resposnes from peers who shared similar queries. I'm also quite proactive and tried to self-help myself by going to Stack Overflow for answers and guidance.

**Is there anything you'd do differently if you were to repeat the learning exploration again?**
Not really as I am still learning. I will take my own initiative to read and research further. 

*Track and Commit*

**How would you describe stage and commit to your non-tech-savvy friend?**
I think staging is the first part of the commit process. It allows one to keep working before fully making (commiting) the changes. 

*Branch, Pull, Merge*

**What is main?**
The main part is like the trunk of a tree. That is the analogy I draw.

**Why create a branch?**
Again, the branch is like the metaphor of the tree branch. It is a part of the file but can be merged with the main body of code if chosen.

**Do the concepts introduced feel intuitive or difficult to understand?**
They seem logical. I like the idea that possibilities can be explored by having branches without the fear of losing information at any point. 

*Using the evidence gathered, describe your core personal values.*

**Explain a situation where you have had an ethical decision to make. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made and the consequences of the action you took.**

There was a situation where we almost encountered Group Think. There was only one female colleague on the team who was unsure if she agreed with everyone. It had been a long day and we all just wanted to make a quick decision. But, I and another friend stuck up for this young lady. It ended up not only saving a company contract but establishing several others. 

**Describe how your culture has influenced your values and identity.**

My values have been shaped by my mother and my father. Both have been managers and have been responsible for the care of many people under their employment. They always believed in treating their staff and clients with respect and care. 

*Using the evidence gathered, describe your strengths and limitations.*

**Evaluate your strengths and limitations in terms of your learning and career development**

I think my strongest asset is my desire to question. My family are passionate readers and we enjoy staying informed about current events and what’s happening in the world. We love to learn and I like to think that the decisions I make are based on reasonable and rational calculations. My limitation in itself may be my continual search for many answers because of my many questions. This can leave me doubtful of the choices I make. 

**Identify which of your strengths might help you in your learning journey and how they might intersect with learning obstacles.**

Yet, I think my curiosity is what will be my biggest strength. It has contributed to one of humankind’s greatest discoveries and I think questioning and constantly evaluating myself through my questions will make me a better student. 

**Share an example from your experience of where you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss the strategies you used at that time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now, and why.**

In one recent meeting, we reduced the tension by breaking the ice through team-building games. The game was to remove a toothpick from the bottom of an empty 1L plastic bottle. The key was to get it out without touching the bottle. Rather than forcing individuals to combat each other, it asked them to work together. We got so many creative ideas from filling the bottle with water to get the toothpick to float to the surface to using a skewer and blue tack fishing rod to hoist it out. Some very very clever cookies indeed. Later when it came to dealing with the business problem I found the group was less likely to go against previous teammates they had worked with within the group game activity. It was a great success and has influenced our application of gamification to the team work environment. Games are not only fun, they are incredibly effective tools for assisting us in learning important vocational, moral and ethical lessons. They are a great way to build trust and get people interacting together.
