#Reflections 

*Command Line*

**In a couple of sentences, how would you describe the command line in plain English? Can you think of an analogy for it?**

It is like a navigation tool for moving around my PC. I see it like using Google Maps.

**Did you stick to the timebox guidelines? If not, what change would you make next time?**

No, because I explored topics a little further in depth. I think I'll manage my time better.
**Name 5 commands you used and what they do.**
The cd (Chnage directory) to display the name of items in the directory.
The mkdir (Make directory) to create a new directory on my system.
The help (help) command to display a set of commands.
The rmdir (remove directory) to remove a directory from my system.
The .. (go back) command to go bact a directory (and also the up arrow key to see options used before)

**Did you learn anything unexpected?**

Yes, the CLI can be very fast when time is taken to learn it.


*Version Control with Git* 

**Whats the difference between Git and GitHub?**
Git is a tool for version control while Guthub is the cloud based service for projects that use Git.

**Can you think of an analogy to describe them?**
I would say a pot luck dinner. Many people use Git and this is uploaded to the cloud. From there, the best bits can be taken to form a project.

**Do you think you would still remember the difference a week from now if you didn't revisit the material?** 
I think so. I have a reasonable familiarity with Git and GitHub.

**Did you stick to the timebox suggestions? If not, why not?**
No, but the time was close. I did have to avoid looking beyond what the activities asked of me. 

*Install and Explore Git*

**What is a GitHub work flow?**

**What did you notice about your own learning? What did you do when you were confused or blocked?**

**Is there anything you'd do differently if you were to repeat the learning exploration again?**
