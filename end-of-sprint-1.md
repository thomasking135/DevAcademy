#Reflections 

*Command Line*

**In a couple of sentences, how would you describe the command line in plain English? Can you think of an analogy for it?**

It is like a navigation tool for moving around my PC. I see it like using Google Maps.

**Did you stick to the timebox guidelines? If not, what change would you make next time?**

No, because I explored topics a little further in depth. I think I'll manage my time better.
**Name 5 commands you used and what they do.**
The cd (Chnage directory) to display the name of items in the directory.
The mkdir (Make directory) to create a new directory on my system.
The help (help) command to display a set of commands.
The rmdir (remove directory) to remove a directory from my system.
The .. (go back) command to go bact a directory (and also the up arrow key to see options used before)

**Did you learn anything unexpected?**

Yes, the CLI can be very fast when time is taken to learn it.


*Version Control with Git* 

**Whats the difference between Git and GitHub?**
Git is a tool for version control while Guthub is the cloud based service for projects that use Git.

**Can you think of an analogy to describe them?**
I would say a pot luck dinner. Many people use Git and this is uploaded to the cloud. From there, the best bits can be taken to form a project.

**Do you think you would still remember the difference a week from now if you didn't revisit the material?** 
I think so. I have a reasonable familiarity with Git and GitHub.

**Did you stick to the timebox suggestions? If not, why not?**
No, but the time was close. I did have to avoid looking beyond what the activities asked of me. 

*Install and Explore Git*

**What is a GitHub work flow?**
It is an automated action added to the repository to manage a project on GitHub.

**What did you notice about your own learning? What did you do when you were confused or blocked?**
I went to the Slack page and often found resposnes from peers who shared similar queries. I'm also quite proactive and tried to self-help myself by going to Stack Overflow for answers and guidance.

**Is there anything you'd do differently if you were to repeat the learning exploration again?**
Not really as I am still learning. I will take my own initiative to read and research further. 

*Track and Commit*

**How would you describe stage and commit to your non-tech-savvy friend?**
I think staging is the first part of the commit process. It allows one to keep working before fully making (commiting) the changes
*Branch, Pull, Merge*

**What is main?**
The main part is like the trunk of a tree. That is the analogy I draw.

**Why create a branch?**
Again, the branch is like the metaphor of the tree branch. It is a part of the file but can be merged with the main body of code if chosen.

**Do the concepts introduced feel intuitive or difficult to understand?**
They seem logical. I like the idea that possibilities can be explored by having branches without the fear of losing information at any point.
