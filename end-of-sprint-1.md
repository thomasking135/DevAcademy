title: "End of Sprint 1"

**In a couple of sentences, how would you describe the command line in plain English? Can you think of an analogy for it?**

It is like a navigation tool for moving around my PC. I see it like using Google Maps.

**Did you stick to the timebox guidelines? If not, what change would you make next time?**

No, because I explored topics a little further in depth. I think I'll manage my time better.
**Name 5 commands you used and what they do.**
The cd (Chnage directory) to display the name of items in the directory.
The mkdir (Make directory) to create a new directory on my system.
The help (help) command to display a set of commands.
The rmdir (remove directory) to remove a directory from my system.
The .. (go back) command to go bact a directory (and also the up arrow key to see options used before)

**Did you learn anything unexpected?**

Yes, the CLI can be very fast when time is taken to learn it.
